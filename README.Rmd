Evaluates hypotheses concerning the distribution of multinomial proportions using bridge sampling.
The bridge sampling routine is able to compute Bayes factors for hypotheses that entail inequality constraints, equality constraints, free parameters, and a mix of all three.
These hypotheses are tested against the encompassing hypothesis, that all parameters vary freely.

## Installation

System requirement is the library `mpfr` with a version bigger than `3.0.0`.
To install `mpfr`, you need a C compiler, preferably GCC.
Detailed information on how to install `mpfr` are available at [https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html](https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html).

On Mac you can install `mpfr` through the Terminal (assuming that `brew` is installed
on your machine).

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
brew install mpfr
```

On Debian or Ubuntu you can install `mpfr` through the Terminal: 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev
```

You can install the released version of `multibridge` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

~~~r
install.packages("multibridge")
~~~

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

~~~r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ASarafoglou/multibridge")
~~~

### Extra Steps for Mac M1

On [https://mac.r-project.org/tools/](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) follow the instructions for gfortran:

```{r screenshot, fig.cap='(ref:screenshot)', message=FALSE, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("manuscript/applescreenshot.png")
``` 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library("multibridge")
# data
x <- c(3, 4, 10, 11, 7, 30)
# priors
a <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
# category labels
factor_levels <- c('theta1', 'theta2', 
                   'theta3', 'theta4', 
                   'theta5', 'theta6')
# constrained hypothesis
Hr            <- c('theta1', '<',  'theta2', '&', 
                   'theta3', '=', 'theta4', ',', 
                   'theta5', '<', 'theta6')
output <- mult_bf_informed(x, Hr, a, factor_levels, seed=2020, niter=2e3)

m1 <- summary(output)
m1
```


## Package dependencies

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("depgraph")

plot_dependency_graph()
```
